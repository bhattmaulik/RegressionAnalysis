This chapter introduces the basics of Econometrics and R to a novice user. Econometrics is a combination of two words: Econo + Metric. Econo refers to concepts of economics, while metric refers to measurement. Let's take an example of the law of demand from microeconomic theory. We know the demand of a commodity will decrease if the price of the commodity increases. But we don't know how much the demand will decrease, given the increase in the price is one unit (i.e., one Dollar, or one Euro, etc.). In Econometrics, we measure such increase or decrease using various experiments.
