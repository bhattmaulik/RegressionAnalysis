In December 2006, Dubai''s Dubai International Capital ({DIC}) approached the club with a takeover bid. {DIC} took its time to study the club''s books and offered £450 million for the club. At the same time, two American businessmen George Gillette and Tom Hicks launched their bid for the club worth £438 million. {DIC} withdrew its offer, and Liverpool accepted the offer from the two American businessmen. The case compares the pros and cons of the two offers, and ends in a debate over the club''s future success rate with the new ownership.},

The success of Dell was largely attributable to its direct selling business model, which was suitable for corporate buyers and bulk purchasers. Dell had an inbuilt advantage of lower costs due to its highly efficient manufacturing operations and supply chain management efficiencies. However, with the changing competitive dynamics, Dell was losing its cost leadership in the industry. Dell's cost advantage against its competitors was eroding as competitors were following practices like mass manufacturing and just-in-time inventory management. After Hewlett-Packard became the market leader in 2007, Dell was considering various options to sustain and regain its leading position in the {PC} industry.},

	abstract = {General Motors ({GM}) was one of the big three automobile manufacturers in the {US}. {GM} was posting operating losses for the past five years (2004-2008). The {US} economy slowdown added woes to {GM}'s decreasing sales as consumers shifted their preference to more fuel efficient vehicles. In the wake of the credit crunch that gripped the {US} financial markets consequent to sub-prime mortgage crisis with global impact, and also poor credit rating of {GM} by rating agencies, {GM} could not raise further capital to upgrade its operations and to pay off its earlier loans. Chairman Rick Wagoner announced in November 2008 that if such a situation continued, {GM} could run out of cash in the coming months. However, he denied possibility of {GM} filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the American bankruptcy code. {GM} including two other major {US} automakers approached the {US} government for possible bailout, the prospects of which are yet to become clear. The case facilitates discussion on the possible strategic options left with {GM} to come out of the liquidity crisis.},

	abstract = {Banks in India are facing the problem of non-performing assets ({NPA}), for which a credible solution is yet to be found. The gross
{NPA} increased by 23\% between 2005-2016. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank of the country, and the Government of
India are considering alternative approaches to reduce the {NPA} level. In May 2017, the Government gave more power to {RBI}’s
Oversight Committee through an ordinance. This paper reviews literature related to management of stressed assets to discuss
the feasibility of the ordinance to reduce the {NPA} level in India. An attempt is made to review the approaches adopted to define
and manage the {NPAs} and to review the relative effectiveness of the approaches to recover {NPAs}.},
