    "text": "Preface\n\n\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the individuals who have played a significant role in the creation of this book on Regression Analysis with R. Their guidance, knowledge, and support have been invaluable throughout this journey.\nFirst and foremost, I extend my deepest appreciation to my esteemed professors, [Professor’s Name], [Professor’s Name], and [Professor’s Name]. Their expertise in statistics and econometrics has shaped my understanding of quantitative analysis and provided a solid foundation for this book. Their dedication to teaching and their unwavering commitment to fostering academic excellence have been instrumental in my growth as a student of econometrics.\nI would like to extend special thanks to my colleague and dear friend, [Colleague’s Name]. Their introduction to the world of R programming language opened up a world of possibilities for me. Their patience, willingness to share their knowledge, and countless hours spent assisting me with R-related challenges have been indispensable. I am grateful for their unwavering support and the collaborative environment we fostered, which significantly enriched my learning experience.\nA heartfelt appreciation goes to the developers of R, an open-source programming language that has revolutionized the field of data analysis and statistical computing. Their tireless efforts in creating and continuously improving R have made it an indispensable tool for researchers and analysts worldwide. Without their dedication, this book would not have been possible.\nI would also like to express my gratitude to the developers of the R packages that have been instrumental in the analysis and visualization techniques presented in this book. Their commitment to excellence, innovation, and user-friendly implementations has immensely contributed to the field of regression analysis. Their packages have not only expanded the capabilities of R but have also facilitated the seamless integration of econometric methodologies into practical applications.\nFinally, I extend my heartfelt thanks to my family and friends who have supported me throughout this writing process. Their encouragement, understanding, and belief in my abilities have been a constant source of motivation.\nTo all those mentioned above, and to anyone else who has contributed to this book in any way, I offer my deepest appreciation. Your guidance, knowledge, and support have been invaluable in shaping this work and have helped me fulfill my goal of sharing the beauty and importance of regression analysis with R.\nThank you.\n[Your Name]"

    "text": "This chapter introduces the basics of Econometrics and R to a novice user. Econometrics is a combination of two words: Econo + Metric. Econo refers to concepts of economics, while metric refers to measurement. Let’s take an example of the law of demand from microeconomic theory. We know the demand of a commodity will decrease if the price of the commodity increases. But we don’t know how much the demand will decrease, given the increase in the price is one unit (i.e., one Dollar, or one Euro, etc.). In Econometrics, we measure such increase or decrease using various experiments."
